## TODO: Camera

[x] Have the camera point to player.transform.forward
[~] If player 2 is within a certain radius, get the midpoint between the two players (with a bias towards the local player)
  (otherwise, just focus on player.transform.forward to avoid large values of field of view)
[x] Create singleton object which collects local player variables (for easy access in later scripts)

## TODO: Other networking

[ ] Further testing with physics (e.g., tutorial level with nuts n' bolts)
[ ] Check critter movements for jerkiness
