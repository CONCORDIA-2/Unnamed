### Setup Notes

- To ensure proper use of the NGSS shadows, go into `Assets/Imported/NGSS/`, take `UnityShadowLibrary.cginc`, and replace Unity's default file in `C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\CGIncludes`. For Mac and Linux setup, as well as directional lights setup, check `Documentation.pdf` in `Assets/Imported/NGSS/`.
